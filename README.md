# Python_HTTP_Server. 

This is a simple HTTP Server to serve files from directory.

***To run the server:***
1) Open a terminal window.
1) Navigate to the directory you want to have the root directory.
1) Execute the command to start the server.
1) Python 3 â€” python -m http.server 8000.
 

Then open a web browser at ##### http://localhost:8000/.
This command will start a single threaded HTTP server bound to 0.0.0.0, the (simple) implications of which are that it is able to respond to internal and external requests.
