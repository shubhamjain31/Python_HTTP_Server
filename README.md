# Python_HTTP_Server. 

This is a simple HTTP Server to serve files from directory using Python SimpleHTTPServer.  
Python SimpleHTTPServer module is a very handy tool. You can use Python SimpleHTTPServer to turn any directory into a simple HTTP web server.

***To run the server:***
- Open a terminal window.
- Navigate to the directory you want to have the root directory.
- Execute the command to start the server.
- Python 3 â€” python -m http.server 8000.  
 

Then open a web browser at http://localhost:8000/.  

This command will start a single threaded HTTP server bound to 0.0.0.0, the (simple) implications of which are that it is able to respond to internal and external requests.
